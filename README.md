# AddWindowsToLibrenms
Powershell script to install, enable and configure snmp on a remote  windows machine and adding the host to librenms.
The script now also adds a rule to the firewall enabeling incoming icmp requests (ping)

Currently only tested on Windows server 2016 you need at least powershell version 3 on both local and remote machine for the script to work
